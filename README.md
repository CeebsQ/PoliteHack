# PoliteHack
A simple Batch program that infinitely creates windows to crash a computer. Please us a VM when running this code. Do not use for malicious purposes.
At first, the program will ask if the user wants to be hacked. If they choose yes (Y), then the infinite windows will start. Otherwise, the program will close itself.
